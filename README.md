# SuperStore-Sales

Using a sample superstore dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting/data?select=train.csv) I answered some questions about consumer preferences and shipping times using a PostgreSQL database. The dataset spans 4 years, with each entry containing details such as Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Customer Name, and Product Name, among other attributes.
