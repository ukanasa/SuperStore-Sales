# SuperStore-Sales

Using a sample superstore dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting/data?select=train.csv) I answered some questions about consumer preferences and shipping times. The data is across 4 years and each record includes an Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Customer Name, and Product Name to name a few.
